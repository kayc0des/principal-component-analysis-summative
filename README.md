# Principal Component Analysis

This repository is part of my summative assignment for Y2T3 Machine Learning.

## Definition of PCA

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction. It identifies the principal components (linear combinations of the original features) that capture the maximum variance in the data. By representing the data in terms of these principal components, PCA allows for easier visualization, analysis, and interpretation, especially in high-dimensional datasets.

## Libraries Used

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- **NumPy**: NumPy is used for numerical computations in Python. It provides efficient array operations and mathematical functions.
- **Matplotlib.pyplot**: Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python. Matplotlib.pyplot provides functions for creating various types of plots, such as line plots, scatter plots, and bar plots.

## Methods Explained

- **np.mean()**: Computes the mean of an array along a specified axis.
- **np.std()**: Calculates the standard deviation of an array along a specified axis.
- **np.cov()**: Computes the covariance matrix of a dataset.
- **np.linalg.eig()**: Computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix.
- **np.argsort()**: Returns the indices that would sort an array.
- **np.matmul()**: Performs matrix multiplication.
- **plt.bar()**: Plots a bar chart of the pricipal components.
